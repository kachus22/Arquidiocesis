### Technology Stack

| Technology | Version  |
| ---------- | -------- |
| NodeJS     | 12.16.01 |

| Firebase   | 08.10.00 |

### Management tools

You should ask for access to this tools if you don't have it already:

- [Github repo](https://github.com/)
- [Backlog](https://asana.com)
- [Heroku](https://arquidiocesis-bda.herokuapp.com/)
- Documentation (Microsoft Teams)

## Development

### Setup the project

Make sure the following tools are installed in your system:

- [Node v12.X.X](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn v1.21.X](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- [Git v2.X.X](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

1. Clone this repository into your local machine

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ProyectoIntegrador2018/arquidiocesis-back.git
$ cd arquidiocesis-back
```

2. Install the project dependencies

```bash
$ yarn install
```

### Running the stack for Development

#### MacOS

1. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
$ export NODE_ENV=development
```

2. Add the file `ServiceAccountKey.json` which contains the Firebase credentials (ask to an admin)

3. Then run the project using

```bash
$ yarn run start:dev
```

That command will open the server on port 8000 by default.

### Run unit and integration tests

In terminal or CLI run the following command:

```
$ yarn test
```

The command will do the following:

1. Present all unit and integration tests for components that are alive in the system.
2. Each unit test will appear with debug information and a green checkmark if it passed
3. Each component has a bunch of unit test and one integration test, the latest will be executed at the end.

### Stop the project

To stop the application run control + C or command + C (mac) in the terminal.

### Set your own port number

#### MacOS

1. Open the terminal and run:

```bash
$ export PORT=<your port number here>
```

### Running the stack for Production

#### MacOS

1. Open terminal and run:

```bash
$ export NODE_ENV=production
```

2. Then run the project:

```bash
$ yarn run start
```

## Documentation

All code is documented using [jsdocs](https://jsdoc.app/) and should come included with the project, if not, read up the section below to [generate documentation](#generating-documentation).

Navigate to **_docs_** folder and open _index.html_. This will open our documentaiton webpage.

### Generating Documentation

> We recommend VSCode for a better coding experience and giving the following plugins a try: [HTML CSS Support Plugin](https://github.com/ecmel/vscode-html-css) by _ecmel_ and [HTML Preview](https://github.com/tht13/html-preview-vscode) by _Thomas Haakon Townsend_

To further develop, [run the stack in development](#Running-the-stack-for-Development) and run the command to generate the documentation:

```
yarn run docs
```

A new **_docs_** folder should have been created.

VSCode mac users run:

```
cmd-shift-v
```

VSCode windows users run:

```
ctrl-shift-v
```

this will open a new preview window, you can drag the pane to the side to preview changes as you develop the code.

## Version control

### Conventional commits

Commit messages are an essential part of software development because they allow us to communicate why our code changed.

To enforce a good convention is followed we're using [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) and [Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint).

Commitizen is a command line utility that will prompt you to fill in any required fields (run with `yarn commit`) and your commit messages will be formatted according to the standards defined by project maintainers. In our case, we're using the [conventional changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) standard with the following structure:

```
type(scope): subject
```

Commitlint is a linter for our commit messages and checks if they meet the [conventional commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).

Commitizen and commitlint will enforce we're creating conventional commit messages and, with the help of [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky), they will prevent us from committing changes without the proper message structure.

### Semantic release

One of the advantages of using the conventional commit format is that dovetails with [SemVer](https://semver.org), by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

[Semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) uses the commit messages to determine the type of changes in the codebase and automatically determines the next semantic version number, updates our version property in `package.json`, generates a changelog, commits the change and publishes the release to GitHub (both the commit and the release tag).

### GitHub templates and workflows

To ensure a standard when creating Pull Requests or Issues (bug or feature request) we've included some templates inside the `.github` folder.

To automate the release of new versions we're using GitHub Actions to run the following workflows:

- **Verify pull request base branch:** Run when a pull request to the `master` branch is open. It will verify the base branch is `dev` and will fail if not the case.
- **Set release version:** Run when changes are pushed to `master`. It will run `semantic-release` and sync the `master` branch with `dev`. To enable this workflow in your repository add the `GH_TOKEN` secret based on a personal access token with repo scope.

To disable a given workflow simply remove the file.

### Unit Testing Validations

To ensure that the changes made didn't affect the current funcionalities of the models run `yarn test`. This command will run all the tests and give the output of each individual test. In case of adding a new features, please add a test suite for each new module.
